# Problem Statement & Scope

## Problem Statement
Formula 1 and racing strategies are often hard to visualize for normal fans. Most racing games are very heavy to download and require expensive hardware. There is a need for a lightweight, web-based simulator that helps users understand race dynamics, lap times, and overtaking without installing heavy software.

## Scope of the Project
The Eclipse Racing Simulator is a web-based application. The scope is limited to a single-player simulation where the computer controls the cars based on predefined algorithms. It focuses on the visualization of data (speed, laps, leaderboard) rather than realistic physics or 3D graphics.

## Target Users
* Formula 1 fans who like data.
* Students learning React and game loops.
* Casual gamers who want a quick simulation.

## High-level Features
1.  *Visual Track Simulation:* Cars moving on a SVG path (Monza track layout).
2.  *Live Analytics HUD:* Real-time updating of speed, energy, and lap times.
3.  *Leaderboard:* Dynamic ranking of drivers based on lap completion and time.
4.  *Simulation Controls:* Pause, Reset, and Speed-up functionality.
