# Eclipse Racing Simulator 🏎

## Overview
Eclipse Racing Simulator is a web-based project built using React and Tailwind CSS. It simulates a 5-car race on a track layout inspired by Monza. [cite_start]The project demonstrates the use of Game Loops in React, SVG path manipulation, and real-time state management[cite: 90].

## Features
* *Real-time Simulation:* Cars move based on different speed attributes and randomization.
* *Dynamic Leaderboard:* Tracks position changes and gap times.
* *Player Stats:* Shows speed (km/h), energy levels, and overtakes.
* *Controls:* You can Pause the simulation, Speed it up (x2, x4), or Reset the race.
* *Responsive UI:* Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean look.

## Technologies Used
* *HTML5 & CSS3*
* *React.js (via CDN)*
* *Tailwind CSS (via CDN)*
* *Babel (for JSX compilation)*

2.  Make sure you are connected to the internet (to load React and Tailwind scripts).
3.  Double-click the file to open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

## Testing
